# Web3Rsvp
Web3RSVP is an event platform where creators can create events and people can go onto this platform and find cool events and RSVP to them. 
Here we'll have a dashboard where you see all the events and you can click on one and you'll be able to RSVP what makes this platform different than what's out there.

That in order for someone to RSVP, they have to deposit some matic and you get this deposit back when you actually arrive to the party or to the event. 
This is to help fight against parties and events that get full of RSVP of people who never actually show up.
So in addition to just RSVP to existing events platform will also allow people to create new events and it'll be fully customizable.

We should be able to go to our home profile and see all of the events that we have created and all of our RSVPs.

Also we have RSVPs to upcoming and past events
